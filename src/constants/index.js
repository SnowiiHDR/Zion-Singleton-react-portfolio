I have a passion for game development as I strive to create powerful and fun games. I am involved with the Development in Games Association at Cornell University where I serve as programmer for the yearly project team, as well as the events director for the club as a whole. With the club I utilize Unity paired with C#, but on my own I use Godot as well. My love for game design began at a young age with a curiousity for how my favorite games were made. I love learning different skills and can adapt to many situations. I work best in collaborative situations and love conversing with team members. Outside of school, I enjoy playing games, fashion, and  cardistry.`;
